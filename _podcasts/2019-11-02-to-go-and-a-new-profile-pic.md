summary: "
<p>Daniel recently gave a presentation at a golang meetup. He and David talk about what Go is and why we use Go to develop our products. Can Go phone home to Google? And why, WHY was Daniel wearing a yellow t-shirt? :P</p>

<p>We then talk about the process of becoming a public figure, which all us founders are currently going through. Daniel already got <a href='https://twitter.com/dehaavi/'>a new slick profile pic for Twitter</a>. And is <a href='https://twitter.com/davegson/'>Davids pic</a> in need of an upgrade too? Let us know ;) Thanks for listening!</p>
